                <div class="mental-health-description">
                    <p>The impact of nutrition on mental health is significant. Nutrient-rich diets with a balance of
                        essential vitamins and minerals play a crucial role in brain function and emotional well-being.
                        Certain nutrients, such as omega-3 fatty acids, B vitamins, and antioxidants, have been linked
                        to cognitive function and mood regulation. A healthy diet can positively influence mental
                        health, while poor nutrition may contribute to mental health disorders or exacerbate existing
                        conditions.
