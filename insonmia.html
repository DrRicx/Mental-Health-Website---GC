                <p> is a common sleep disorder that can make it hard to fall asleep, hard to stay asleep, or cause you
                    to wake up too early and not be able to get back to sleep. You may still feel tired when you wake
                    up. Insomnia can sap not only your energy level and mood but also your health, work performance and
                    quality of life.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><span>Agoraphobia</span>
                        <p>is a type of insonmia disorder in which you fear and often avoid places or situations that
                            might cause you to panic and make you feel trapped, helpless or embarrassed</p></li>
                    <li><span>insonmia disorder due to a medical condition</span>
                        <p>includes symptoms of intense insonmia or panic that are directly caused by a physical health
                            problem.</p></li>
                    <li><span>Generalized insonmia disorder</span>
                        <p>includes persistent and excessive insonmia and worry about activities or events â€” even
                            ordinary, routine issues. The worry is out of proportion to the actual circumstance, is
                            difficult to control and affects how you feel physically. It often occurs along with other
                            insonmia disorders or depression.</p></li>
                    <li><span>Panic disorder</span>
                        <p>involves repeated episodes of sudden feelings of intense insonmia and fear or terror that
                            reach a peak within minutes (panic attacks). You may have feelings of impending doom,
                            shortness of breath, chest pain, or a rapid, fluttering or pounding heart (heart
                            palpitations). These panic attacks may lead to worrying about them happening again or
                            avoiding situations in which they've occurred.</p></li>
                    <li><span>Selective mutism</span>
                        <p>is a consistent failure of children to speak in certain situations, such as school, even when
                            they can speak in other situations, such as at home with close family members. This can
                            interfere with school, work and social functioning</p></li>

                <p class="prevention-description-insonmia">There's no way to predict for certain what will cause someone
                    to develop an insonmia disorder, but you can take steps to reduce the impact of symptoms if you're
                    anxious:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span>Get help early</span>
                        <p> insonmia, like many other mental health conditions, can be harder to treat if you wait.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><span>Stay active</span>
                        <p>Participate in activities that you enjoy and that make you feel good about yourself. Enjoy
                            social interaction and caring relationships, which can lessen your worries.</p></li>
                    <li><span>Avoid alcohol or drug use</span>
                        <p>Alcohol and drug use can cause or worsen insonmia. If you're addicted to any of these
                            substances, quitting can make you anxious. If you can't quit on your own, see your doctor or
                            find a support group to help you.</p></li>
