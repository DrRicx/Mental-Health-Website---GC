            <div class="text-description">
                <p> is a serious mental disorder in which people interpret reality abnormally. Schizophrenia may result
                    in some combination of hallucinations, delusions, and extremely disordered thinking and behavior
                    that impairs daily functioning, and can be disabling.</p>

                <p class="symptoms-schizophrenia-title" style="font-size: 30px; font-weight: bold;"> Common
                    schizophrenia Symptoms Include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span>Delusions</span>
                        <p>These are false beliefs that are not based in reality. For example, you think that you're
                            being harmed or harassed; certain gestures or comments are directed at you; you have
                            exceptional ability or fame; another person is in love with you; or a major catastrophe is
                            about to occur. Delusions occur in most people with schizophrenia.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><span>Hallucinations</span>
                        <p>These usually involve seeing or hearing things that don't exist. Yet for the person with
                            schizophrenia, they have the full force and impact of a normal experience. Hallucinations
                            can be in any of the senses, but hearing voices is the most common hallucination.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><span>Disorganized thinking (speech)</span>
                        <p>Disorganized thinking is inferred from disorganized speech. Effective communication can be
                            impaired, and answers to questions may be partially or completely unrelated. Rarely, speech
                            may include putting together meaningless words that can't be understood, sometimes known as
                            word salad.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><span>Negative symptoms.</span>
                        <p>This refers to reduced or lack of ability to function normally. For example, the person may
                            neglect personal hygiene or appear to lack emotion (doesn't make eye contact, doesn't change
                            facial expressions or speaks in a monotone). Also, the person may lose interest in everyday
                            activities, socially withdraw or lack the ability to experience pleasure.</p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p style="margin-top: 30px">Symptoms can vary in type and severity over time, with periods of worsening
                    and remission of symptoms. Some symptoms may always be present.</p>

                    If you suspect that someone you know is exhibiting symptoms of schizophrenia, engage in open and
                    empathetic communication with them about your concerns. While you cannot compel someone to seek
                    professional help, you can provide encouragement and support. Assist your loved one in locating a
                    qualified doctor or mental health professional to initiate the necessary care and assistance.</p>
