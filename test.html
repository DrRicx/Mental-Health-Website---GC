                <div class="test-title-description">
                    <p>Self-tests can help individuals identify potential mental health concerns early on. Early
                        detection allows for timely intervention and support, preventing issues from escalating into
                        more severe conditions.Moreover, completing a self-assessment can increase self-awareness about
                        one's mental health. It prompts individuals to reflect on their emotions, thoughts, and
                        behaviors, fostering a better understanding of their mental well-being.

                    <p>The Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) is a widely used self-report tool for assessing the
                        severity of depression. It consists of nine questions that ask individuals about their
                        experiences over the past two weeks. Each question is scored from 0 to 3, and the scores are
                        summed to obtain a total score. The PHQ-9 is commonly used in clinical settings and research to
                        screen for and monitor depression.
