                <p> Eating disorders are serious health conditions that affect both your physical and mental health.
                    These conditions include problems in how you think about food, eating, weight and shape, and in your
                    eating behaviors. These symptoms can affect your health, your emotions and your ability to function
                    in important areas of life.</p>

                <h1 class="title-symptoms">Common Eating disorder Symptoms</h1>
                <p class="symptoms-description">Symptoms vary, depending on the type of eating disorder. Anorexia,
                    bulimia and binge-eating disorder are the most common eating disorders. People with eating disorders
                    can have all different body types and sizes.</p>
                <h2 class="title-symptoms-1">Anorexia</h2>
                <p class="symptoms-description">also called anorexia nervosa, can be a life-threatening eating disorder.
                    It includes an unhealthy low body weight, intense fear of gaining weight, and a view of weight and
                    shape that is not realistic. Anorexia often involves using extreme efforts to control weight and
                    shape, which often seriously interfere with health and daily life.</p>
                <h2 class="title-symptoms-1">Bulimia</h2>
                <p class="symptoms-description">also called bulimia nervosa, is a serious, sometimes life-threatening
                    eating disorder. Bulimia includes episodes of bingeing, commonly followed by episodes of purging.
                    Sometimes bulimia also includes severely limiting eating for periods of time. This often leads to
                    stronger urges to binge eat and then purge.</p>
                <h2 class="title-symptoms-1">Binge-eating disorder</h2>
                <p class="symptoms-description">involves eating food in a short amount of time. When bingeing, it feels
                    like there's no control over eating. But binge eating is not followed by purging. During a binge,
                    people may eat food faster or eat more food than planned. Even when not hungry, eating may continue
                    long past feeling uncomfortably full.

                <p class="symptoms-description">The exact cause of eating disorders is not known. As with other mental
                    health conditions, there may be different causes, such as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span>Genetics</span>
                        <p>Some people may have genes that increase their risk of developing eating disorders.</span>
                            Your circadian rhythms act as an internal clock, guiding such things as your sleep-wake
                            cycle, metabolism and body temperature. Disrupting your body's circadian rhythms can lead to
                            insomnia. Causes include jet lag from traveling across multiple time zones, working a late
                            or early shift, or frequently changing shifts.</p></li>
                    <li><span>Biology</span>
                        <p>Biological factors, such as changes in brain chemicals, may play a role in eating
                            disorders.</p></li>

                <p class="prevention-description-eating-disorder">To develop healthy eating habits and lifestyle behaviors:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p> Choose a healthy diet rich in whole grains, fruits and vegetables. Limit salt, sugar,
                            alcohol, saturated fat and trans fats. Avoid extreme dieting. If you need to lose weight,
                            talk to your health care provider or a dietitian to create a plan that meets your needs</p>

                    <li>

                            as brisk walking. Choose activities that you enjoy, so you're more likely to do them.
