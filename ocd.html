            <div class="text-description">
                <p> features a pattern of unwanted thoughts and fears known as obsessions. These obsessions lead you to
                    do repetitive behaviors, also called compulsions. These obsessions and compulsions get in the way of
                    daily activities and cause a lot of distress.</p>

                <h1 class="title-symptoms">Symptoms</h1>
                <p class="symptoms-description">Obsessive-compulsive disorder usually includes both obsessions and
                    compulsions. But it's also possible to have only obsession symptoms or only compulsion symptoms. You
                    may or may not know that your obsessions and compulsions are beyond reason. But they take up a great
                    deal of time, reduce your quality of life, and get in the way of your daily routines and
                    responsibilities.</p>
                <p class="title-symptoms-1">Obsessions have a theme and of:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fear of contamination or dirt.</li>
                    <li> Doubting and having a hard time dealing with uncertainty.
                    </li>
                    <li> Needing things to be orderly and balanced.
                    </li>
                    <li>Aggressive or horrific thoughts about losing control and harming yourself or others.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="title-symptoms-1">Examples are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fear of being contaminated by touching objects others have touched.</li>
                    <li>Intense stress when objects aren't orderly or facing a certain way.</li>
                    <li>Images of driving your car into a crowd of people.</li>
                    <li>Unpleasant sexual images.</li>
                </ul>
                <h1 class="title-symptoms">Compulsion Symptoms</h1>
                <p class="symptoms-description">repetitive behaviors that you feel driven to do. These repetitive
                    behaviors or mental acts are meant to reduce anxiety related to your obsessions or prevent something
                    bad from happening. But taking part in the compulsions brings no pleasure and may offer only limited
                    relief from anxiety.</p>

                    <li><span>Biology</span>
                        <p>may be due to changes in your body's natural chemistry or brain functions.</p></li>
                    <li><span>Genetics</span>
                        <p>may have a genetic component, but specific genes have yet to be found.</p></li>
                    <li><span>Learning</span>
                        <p>Obsessive fears and compulsive behaviors can be learned from watching family members or learning them over time.
