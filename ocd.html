                <p> is a common sleep disorder that can make it hard to fall asleep, hard to stay asleep, or cause you
                    to wake up too early and not be able to get back to sleep. You may still feel tired when you wake
                    up. Insomnia can sap not only your energy level and mood but also your health, work performance and
                    quality of life.</p>

                <p class="impact-insonmia">Causes of insonmia</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span>Stress</span>
                        <p>Concerns about work, school, health, finances or family can keep your mind active at night,
                            making it difficult to sleep. Stressful life events or trauma — such as the death or illness
                            of a loved one, divorce, or a job loss — also may lead to insomnia</p></li>
                    <li><span>Travel or work schedule</span>
                        <p>Your circadian rhythms act as an internal clock, guiding such things as your sleep-wake
                            cycle, metabolism and body temperature. Disrupting your body's circadian rhythms can lead to
                            insomnia. Causes include jet lag from traveling across multiple time zones, working a late
                            or early shift, or frequently changing shifts.</p></li>
                    <li><span>Poor sleep habits</span>
                        <p>Poor sleep habits include an irregular bedtime schedule, naps, stimulating activities before
                            bed, an uncomfortable sleep environment, and using your bed for work, eating or watching TV.
                            Computers, TVs, video games, smartphones or other screens just before bed can interfere with
                            your sleep cycle</p></li>
                    <li><span>Eating too much late in the evening</span>
                        <p>Having a light snack before bedtime is OK, but eating too much may cause you to feel
                            physically uncomfortable while lying down. Many people also experience heartburn, a backflow
                            of acid and food from the stomach into the esophagus after eating, which may keep you
                            awake.</p></li>
